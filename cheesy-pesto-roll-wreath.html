        <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
                        <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                        Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Draw a 5-inch circle on the center of the parchment paper.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
                        <p>Open both cans of dough and separate crescents into 16 triangles. Arrange the triangles on the prepared 
                        baking sheet the flat edges lined up and overlapping along the 5-inch circle and the points facing outward; it will resemble a sunburst.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
                        <p>Combine cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, and 6 tablespoons pesto in a bowl. Mix until well combined, 
                        then spread around the center of the ring of crescent dough.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
                        <p>Wrap each dough triangle up over filling and tucking it under the bottom to secure. 
                        Repeat around the entire ring. Brush remaining 2 tablespoons pesto on top.</p>  
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
                        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the dough is golden brown and cooked, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven 
                            and allow to cool for 5 minutes.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
                        <p>Slice into individually portioned rings, but keep all the rings in place in the shape of a wreath. 
                        Garnish with rosemary sprigs and cherry tomatoes.</p>
