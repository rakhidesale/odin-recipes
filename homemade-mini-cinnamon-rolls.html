        <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
                        <p>Mix together milk and water in a glass measuring cup for the dough. Microwave mixture until it 
                            reaches 105 degrees F to 115 degrees F (40 degrees C to 46 degrees C), 30 to 60 seconds. </p>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
                        <p>Whisk together flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, melted butter, and milk mixture. 
                            Beat with an electric mixer at medium speed until a soft dough forms and begins to pull away from sides of bowl,
                             3 to 5 minutes. (Dough will be sticky.) Lightly grease a bowl. Transfer dough to the bowl and turn to coat. 
                             Chill, covered, until dough is easy to handle, at least 2 hours or up to overnight.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
                        <p>Grease two 9-inch round cake pans or two 8x8-inch baking pans. </p> 
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
                        <p>Stir together brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Punch down dough; divide in half. Roll out one portion 
                            of dough on a lightly floured surface into a 6x16-inch rectangle. (If dough springs back when rolling, let rest
                             for 5 to 10 minutes.) Spread 2 tablespoons softened butter over the dough. Sprinkle half of the cinnamon-brown 
                             sugar mixture over butter; gently pat mixture so it adheres to the dough. </p> 
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
                        <p>Starting on a long side, roll up dough and pinch along seam to seal. Slice dough log into 16 (1-inch-thick) pieces.
                             Put rolls, cut sides down, in one of the prepared pans. Repeat with the remaining dough, cinnamon-sugar, and 
                             softened butter. Let rise, covered, in a warm place until rolls nearly double in size, about 30 minutes. </p> 
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
                        <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </p> 
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Step 7</strong></li>
                        <p>Bake until rolls until golden brown, 17 to 22 minutes. Cool in pan on a wire rack 10 minutes. </p> 
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Step 8</strong></li>
                        <p>Meanwhile for the icing, beat cream cheese, softened butter, milk, and vanilla with an electric mixer at medium 
                            speed until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually beat in powdered sugar until smooth. Drizzle rolls with icing and 
                            serve warm. </p> 
                    <br>
