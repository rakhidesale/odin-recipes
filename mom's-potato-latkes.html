                Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful any time of the year! 
                This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best potato latke I've had. I usually end up making a 
                second batch because they disappear so quickly. I've tried other recipes and always return to this one. 
                Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.

                <ul>
                    <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
                    <li>¼ cup grated onion</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
                    <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
                        <p>Mix potato, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. </p>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
                        <p>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. </p> 
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
                        <p>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against the side of the bowl 
                        to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your 
                        spoon so they are an even thickness. </p> 
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
                        <p>Cook in batches in the hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a paper towel-line plate. </p> 
                    <br>
